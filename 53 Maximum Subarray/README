Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

# dp is really simple and straightforward by making dp[i] the largest subarray ending in the i

# divide and conquer: 

#greedy(really interesting): find the largest difference between the sums when you summing up the array from left to right. The largest difference corresponds to the sub-array with largest sum.
