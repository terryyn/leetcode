Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

#classical greedy, only notice that instead of choosing the index with biggest capacity in the range
choose the index which can reach farthest from the starting index
