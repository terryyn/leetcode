Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.


#multiple ways to do it. Mine is close to using 2 pointers.
  start from the first, find the first that is equal or larger than it, then add the trapping water between, jump to that right one
  key is if there is no height later larger than the starting, then get the biggest possible one(ie. left > right)
  
# an interesting way is using dp.
