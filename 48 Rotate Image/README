You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
Note:
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
 

this is a general method for image rotate ---> reverse the list and swap
easy to figure out if drawing on sketch paper
